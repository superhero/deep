# README: Deep Utilities

This repository contains a set of deep utility classes for handling common operations like cloning, freezing, merging, and assigning objects and arrays. Below is the documentation for each utility class, its purpose, and examples.

---

## 1. **DeepAssign**

### Purpose:
Deeply assigns properties from one or more source objects to a target object. Handles nested structures, arrays, and property descriptors.

### Features:
- Merges arrays with unique values.
- Deeply merges nested objects.
- Handles property descriptors (`writable`, `configurable`, `enumerable`).

### Example:
```javascript
import deepassign from '@superhero/deep/assign'

const target = { foo: { bar: 1 } }
const source = { foo: { baz: 2 } }

deepassign.assign(target, source)

console.log(target) // { foo: { bar: 1, baz: 2 } }
```

---

## 2. **DeepMerge**

### Purpose:
Deeply merges two or more objects into a new object. Handles nested structures, circular references, arrays, and property descriptors.

### Features:
- Merges arrays with unique values while maintaining order.
- Merges nested objects with priority for restrictive property descriptors.
- Detects and handles circular references.

### Example:
```javascript
import deepmerge from '@superhero/deep/merge'

const obj1 = { foo: { bar: 1 }, arr: [1, 2] }
const obj2 = { foo: { baz: 2 }, arr: [2, 3] }

const result = deepmerge.merge(obj1, obj2)

console.log(result)
// { foo: { bar: 1, baz: 2 }, arr: [1, 2, 3] }
```

---

## 3. **DeepFreeze**

### Purpose:
Recursively freezes an object, making it immutable. Handles nested structures and circular references.

### Features:
- Freezes nested objects and arrays.
- Handles circular references gracefully.

### Example:
```javascript
import deepfreeze from '@superhero/deep/freeze'

const obj = { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
obj.foo.self = obj.foo // Circular reference

deepfreeze.freeze(obj)

obj.foo.bar = 'new value' // TypeError: Cannot assign to read-only property
```

---

## 4. **DeepClone**

### Purpose:
Creates a deep clone of an object. Supports nested structures, circular references, arrays, and custom serialization methods.

### Features:
- Uses `structuredClone` if available, falling back to JSON-based cloning.
- Handles nested objects, arrays, and custom `toJSON` methods.
- Supports circular references if `structuredClone` is available.

### Example:
```javascript
import deepclone from '@superhero/deep/clone'

const obj = { foo: { bar: 'baz' }, arr: [1, 2, 3] }

const clone = deepclone.clone(obj)

console.log(clone) // Deeply cloned object
console.log(clone === obj) // false
```

## Testing
Each utility class has a set of unit tests to ensure correctness across different cases.

### Run Tests
To execute the tests:
```bash
npm test
```
